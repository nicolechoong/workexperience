The Transaction Security and guarantees provided under this Agreement may not in all jurisdictions continue to secure or guarantee the increased Commitment or be for the benefit of the Increase Lender. It is the responsibility of the Increase Lender to ascertain whether any other documents or other formalities are required to confirm the Transaction Security/guarantees in any jurisdiction and/or for it to benefit from such Transaction Security and/or guarantees and, if so, to arrange for execution of those documents and completion of those formalities.

(iv) each of the Obligors and any Increase Lender shall assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another as the Obligors and the Increase Lender would have assumed and/or acquired had the Increase Lender been an Original Lender in respect of that part of the increased Commitments which it is to assume;29
(v) each Increase Lender shall become a Host as a "Lender" and any Increase Lender and each of the other Finance Parties shall assume obligations towards one another and acquire rights against one another as that Increase Lender and those Finance Parties would have assumed and/or acquired had the Increase Lender been an Original Lender in respect of that part of the increased Commitments which it is to assume;
(vi) the Commitments of the other Lenders shall continue in full force and effect; and (vii) any increase in the Commitments relating to a Facility shall, subject to the

LMA.LeveragedFinanceFacilityAgmt.12 - 68 - 7 August 2017
(c) The Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Increase Confirmation delivered to it by an Increase Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the assumption of the increased Commitments by that Increase Lender.

(e) The consent of the Issuing Bank is required for an increase in the Total Revolving Facility Commitments.
(f) Each Increase Lender, by executing the Increase Confirmation, confirms (for the avoidance of doubt) that the Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the date on which the increase becomes effective in accordance with this Agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same extent as it would have been had it been an Original Lender.
(g) [The Parent shall promptly on demand pay the Agent and the Security Agent the amount of all costs and expenses (excluding legal fees) reasonably incurred by either of them and, in the case of the Security Agent, by any Receiver or Delegate in connection with any increase in Commitments under this Clause 2.3.]
(h) [The Increase Lender shall, on the date upon which the increase takes effect, pay to the Agent (for its own account) a fee in an amount equal to the fee which would be payable under Clause 30.4 (Assignment or transfer fee) if the increase was a transfer pursuant to Clause 30.6 (Procedure for transfer) and if the Increase Lender was a New Lender.]
(i) [The Parent may pay to the Increase Lender a fee in the amount and at the times agreed between the Parent and the Increase Lender in a Fee Letter.]
(j) Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to find an Increase Lender and in no event shall any Lender whose Commitment is replaced by an Increase Lender be required to pay or surrender any of the fees received by such Lender pursuant to the Finance Documents.
(k) Clause 30.5 (Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders) shall applymutatis mutandis in this Clause 2.3 in relation to an Increase Lender as if references in that Clause to:
(i) an "Existing Lender" were references to all the Lenders immediately prior to the relevant increase;

LMA.LeveragedFinanceFacilityAgmt.12 - 69 - 7 August 2017 2.4 Finance Parties' rights and obligations
(a)
(b)
The obligations of each Finance Party under the Finance Documents are several. Failure by a Finance Party to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents does not affect the obligations of any other Party under the Finance Documents. No Finance Party is responsible for the obligations of any other Finance Party under the Finance Documents.
The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance Documents are separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Finance Documents to a Finance Party from an Obligor is a separate and independent debt in respect of which a Finance Party shall be entitled to enforce its rights in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The rights of each Finance Party include any debt owing to that Finance Party under the Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, any part of a Loan or any other amount owed by an Obligor which relates to a Finance Party's participation in a Facility or its role under a Finance Document (including any such amount payable to the Agent on its behalf) is a debt owing to that Finance Party by that Obligor.
A Finance Party may, except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents, separately enforce its rights under or in connection with the Finance Documents.
(c)
2.5 Obligors' Agent
(a) Each Obligor (other than the Parent) by its execution of this Agreement or an Accession Deed irrevocably appoints the Parent (acting through one or more authorised signatories) to act on its behalf as its agent in relation to the Finance Documents and irrevocably authorises:
(i) the Parent on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself contemplated by this Agreement to the Finance Parties and to give all notices and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation Requests), [to agree any Incremental Facility Terms and to deliver any Incremental Facility Notice,] to make such agreements and to effect the relevant amendments, supplements and variations capable of being given, made or effected by any Obligor notwithstanding that they may affect the Obligor, without further reference to or the consent of that Obligor; and
(ii) each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to that Obligor pursuant to the Finance Documents to the Parent,
and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given the notices and instructions (including, without limitation, any Utilisation Requests) or executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or variations, or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication. LMA.LeveragedFinanceFacilityAgmt.12 - 70 - 7 August 2017
(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment, supplement, variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors' Agent or given to the Obligors' Agent under any Finance Document on behalf of another Obligor or in connection with any Finance Document (whether or not known to any other Obligor and whether occurring before or after such other Obligor became an Obligor under any Finance Document) shall be binding for all purposes on that Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly made, given or concurred with it. In the event of any conflict between any notices or other communications of the Obligors' Agent and any other Obligor, those of the Obligors' Agent shall prevail.
3. PURPOSE
